            <h2>The Goku simulations for cosmological emulation</h2>
            <p>
            The standard model of cosmology, known as the ΛCDM model, has been remarkably successful in explaining the large-scale structure of the universe. However, recent observations might suggest that the model is incomplete, motivating the need for more sophisticated models that can accurately describe the universe's evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
            We performed the Goku simulation suite, a state-of-the-art cosmological N-body simulation suite designed for cosmological emulation. Goku covers a 10-dimensional parameter space that includes the ΛCDM parameters and key extensions--dynamical dark energy, massive neutrinos, the effective number of neutrinos and the running of the primordial scalar spectral index. The suite enables precise predictions for cosmological surveys like DESI, LSST, and Euclid, facilitating improved parameter inference and model testing. 
            </p>
            Developed within the MF-Box framework, Goku combines high- and low-fidelity simulations, reducing computational costs by ~94% compared to traditional single-fidelity methods. We have built a Gaussian process emulator for the matter power spectrum, GokuEmu, which can predict the matter power spectrum with high accuracy in an unprecedentedly high-dimensional parameter space.

            <h2>The Astrid simulation</h2>
            <p>As the largest ever cosmological hydrodynamical simulation completed to z=0 (present day), Astrid provides the best view of the predictions of the standard cosmological model for a wide range of topics in galaxy and structure formation. One of the most timely will be the ability of Astrid with its detailed models of black hole formation and merging, to study the background of gravitational waves indicated by recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements. Another will be predictions for the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The large dynamic range of Astrid on one hand allows detailed studies of galaxy and massive black hole evolution at high resolution, and on the other hand allows systematic studies of rare massive systems with the large cosmic volume. Astrid is enabling studies of high redshift galaxies and black holes that are valuable for current and future observations such as the James Webb Telescope, LISA gravitational wave observatory, and DESI galaxy surveys. </p>

            My role in the Astrid project involves running the Subfind halo-finding algorithm within the AREPO code to identify subhalos and galaxies in the simulation. This process is essential for analyzing the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. Additionally, I contributed to running the simulation down to z = 0. Currently, I am working on a dark matter-only version of Astrid, which will be compared to the hydrodynamical version to assess the impact of baryonic physics on large-scale cosmic structures.</p>

            <h2>Simulations of radiative turbulent mixing layers</h2>

            <p>
                I am currently working on topics related to galaxies. Specifically, my research focuses on tubulent mixing
            layers (TMLs) arising from shear flows in the context of Astronomy (e.g., galactic winds and cold gas clouds, high-velocity clouds and
            hot haloes of galaxies), which is an attractive explanation of the ubiquity of some ions (most notably, O VI) detected in absorption in quasar sightlines intersecting the CGM.
            </p>


            <h3>1 Radiative tubulent mixing layers with weak cooling at high Mach numbers</h3>

            (in preparation, expected to be submitted to MNRAS around Jan 2022)</br>
            We carry out a research to investigate the properties of weak cooling turbulent mixing layers (this is an advanced extension of one of our previous study - see the next section for a more detailed introduction to background, <em>Hydrodynamic sim...</em>), in which we run a suite of simulations with various Mach numbers (shear velocity/hot gas sound speed), and find a series of interesting phenomena and results. Below are selected ones:

            <h4>The separation of dissipation and cooling layers</h4>

            We find in the weak cooling regime (e.g., with low metallicity or pressure), the well-developed turbulent region can be divided into two parts in supersonic cases (Mach number > 1): the cooling layer and the dissipation layer. The former is where efficient mixing and radiative cooling are occurring, while in the latter one the turbulent dissipation is significant. The situation is tremendously different from that in the strong cooling regime, where the dissipation and cooling should be highly coupled spatially. The picture below illustrates a typical turbulent region in the weak cooling regime.

            </div>
            <div class="clear"></div>

            Also, we find the cooling layer width is almost independent of Mach number, resulting from the independence of the local turbulent velocity in the mixing layer on Mach number. This is distinct from cases of fast cooling systems.

            <h4>O VI column density does not depend on Mach number</h4>

            For the mixing layer width is almost independent of Mach number once the shear flows are supersonic, the typical ions' column densities will not depend on the relative velocity between the hot and cold gas, too. One representative is O VI, which peaks at \(T\sim 3\times 10^5\,\)K.

            In subsonic cases, the column density of O VI increases with Mach number, however, it would not be enhanced by Mach number anymore in supersonic cases. Some typical ions' column densities are plotted against Mach number below.

            <h3>2 Hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent mixing layers of galactic winds</h3>

            Galactic winds (GWs) have long been thought of as an important role in galaxy formation and evolution, which continuously replenish medium in and around galaxies with metals and gas, through activities such as AGN outflows, stellar winds and supernova explosions. Meanwhile, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) has drew astronomers' attention in recent years, and some interesting observational results were introduced, amongst which high column densities of some specific ions (e.g., O VI) should be an unavoidable problem to investigate. Given the very short cooling timescales of the gas that could contain such great number of those ions (for very restricted temperature range), the turbulent mixing layers arising from the interactions (caused by velocity shear between hot and cold phases) between hot gas outflows and ambient cold/cool gases are likely to be an explanation, in addition to that from cold gas clouds and warm gas environment. GWs have wide ranges of physical parameters (temperature, pressure, metallicity and velocity shear), but there is few comprehensive parameter studies on TMLs that could cover the real physical conditions of GWs. Therefore, we performed a parameter study (hydrodynamic simulations) to explore the relations between ion column densities and physical parameters in wider ranges. Besides confirming the strong positive correlation between ion column densities and metallicity, we have some important discoveries: TMLs are not responsible for a few ions' abundance (e.g., Si IV ) under low-pressure conditions; the thickness of TMLs arising from  supersonic flow does not strongly depend on the velocity shear \(v_\mathrm{sh}\); the exploration of temperature space can be approximately converted to the dependence of the TMLs in steady state on velocity shear, which greatly simplifies O VI related problems.</br>
        </br>
            Our fiducial simulation is initiated with two uniform fluids with a relative velocity of \(100\,\)km/s. One's temperature \(T=10^4\,\)K, and another one has \(T=10^6\,\)K. And an isobaric condition is assumed, so the overdensity \(\delta = 100\). The temporal evolution of the system in the fiducial run can be visualized by slices of temperature below.</br>

            Below are some of the important results in this study.

            <h4>The "conversion relation" between shear velocity and temperature</h4>

            In previous work in this field, shear velocity \(v_\mathrm{sh}\) and density contrast (thus temperature) \(\delta \) have usually been treated as two independent variables. However, our study shows these two kind of conditions can be equivalently converted to each other when specific questions are under investigation. Our research focuses on the gas of intermediate temperature \(T\sim 10^5\,\)K, and we find shear flows with different temperature pairs (e.g., \(10^3\,\)K and \(10^7\,\)K) can be equivalently converted to a case with (\(10^4\,\)K and \(10^6\,\)K), but with another shear velocity. Here, based on parameters of the fiducial run, we establish a formula to express the conversion relation between these two variables:
            
            $$ v_\mathrm{sh}' =  \frac{10^6\,\mathrm{K}}{T_\mathrm{hot}} v_\mathrm{sh} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{hot}}{\rho (10^6\,\mathrm{K})}v_\mathrm{sh}, $$

            where \(v_\mathrm{sh}\) is the real initial relative velocity between the hot and cold gas flows, \(T_\mathrm{hot}\) and \(\rho_\mathrm{hot}\) are properties of the hot gas, and \(v_\mathrm{sh}'\) is the equivalent shear velocity, with which we can regard the TML in the system as that in a case with the fiducial temperature pair. In another word, the mixing layer with the initial condition (\(v_\mathrm{sh}'\), \(T_\mathrm{cold}\lesssim 10^4\,\)K, \(T_\mathrm{hot}\)) is similar to that with (\(v_\mathrm{sh}\), \(10^4\,\)K, \(10^6\,\)K). They will bring the same amount of typical ions, such as O VI and C IV.

            <h4>The effect of photoionization on ion column densities</h4>

            When collissinal ionization equilibrium is assumed, it is conceivable that the column densities, e.g., \(N_\mathrm{CIV}\)， will increase with the ambient pressure \(P\). However, we find when photoionization is taken into account, the relationship between them will be complicated - different ions are influenced in different ways. 

            In the pressure range we have explored ( \(P/k_\mathrm{B} = 10, 10^2, 10^3\,\mathrm{K\, cm^{-3}}\)), O VI is abundant in the mixing layer while lack in both cold gas and hot gas, and \(N_\mathrm{OVI}\) monotonously increases with \(P\). By contrast, the ion fraction of Si IV will be changed by pressure significantly, i.e., Si IV peaks at a different temperature when another pressure is initiated. And then the most important contributor will be cold gas (\(10^4\,\)K), instead of the mixing layer. This can be easily get across by the projections of Si IV number density below.
