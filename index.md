## Education
University of Science and Technology of China  
Major: Astronomy/Astrophysics  
School: School of Physical Sciences  August 2017 - present 

## Research

### Interests
I’m interested in various astrophysical topics, such as black hole formation, CGM related problems (e.g.,turbulent mixing layers). And I’ve been doing some work on the formation of seed-BHs, and dedicated to research on turbulent mixing layers for solving mid ions related problems. Besides, I am also eager to get to know more about observational astronomy and cosmology theories.
