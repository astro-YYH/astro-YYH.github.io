            I share some other meaningful and special activities in my life here.

            <h2>Hair Donation</h2>

            <div id="donation_describe" style="height: 450px; float: left; width: 416px;">
                At the beginning of 2019, I learned from the Internet that there are
                charity events via which people could donate hair to cancer patients. My hair is of great quality,
                which may help cancer patients with hair loss, so I decided to preserve my hair and donate it
                finally. In November 2020, I cut all my hair that I have had for nearly two years, which has been
                more than 30 cm, and donated it to a charity organization called Tsingsi Hair Donation Charity.
                The organization should have made my hair into a wig and given it to a female cancer patient who
                has lost her hair due to chemotherapy.
